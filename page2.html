            <p> Myth #1: MSG causes obesity </p>
            <p> ~ </p>
            <p> Scientific research has shown that glutamate can be administered in very large doses to humans on a long-term basis with no ill effects. The consumption of MSG in the normal diet, even at very high amounts, does not raise plasma glutamate concentrations. This is because intestinal cells and liver cells metabolize almost all of the dietary glutamate as it is absorbed (they use it to make energy); the dietary glutamate never makes it into the body’s general circulation.</p>

            <p> Myth #2: MSG causes allergic reactions </p>
            <p> ~ </p>
            <p> First off, MSG is not an allergen, so it will not cause allergies. Furthermore, decades of research have failed to demonstrate that MSG causes allergic reactions. </p>

            <p> Myth #3: MSG causes effects in the brain. </p>
            <p> ~ </p>
            <p> Numerous studies show that MSG does not have negative effects on the central nervous system of the brain. Even in one study where plasma glutamate was raised 10 times above normal, which never occurs in real life, none of the glutamate entered the brain. This shows the effectiveness of the brain in being able to exclude glutamate from entering the brain. Yet, over the years, we have seen anecdotal reports linking MSG to headaches and nausea.  Ever since the first incidents were reported, there’s been no strong, medical evidence to support these claims. The FDA investigated some of these claims and has “never been able to confirm that the MSG caused the reported effects.” In addition, the FDA commissioned a group of independent scientists from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology to examine the safety of MSG in the 1990s. The FASEB report determined that MSG is safe. </p>
