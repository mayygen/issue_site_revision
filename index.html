          MSG, also known as monosodium glutamate, is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. MSG is found naturally in some foods including tomatoes and cheese in this glutamic acid form. It is a popular seasoning and flavor enhancer. MSG (by the Ajinomoto Group) is produced through fermentation of plant-based ingredients such as sugar cane, sugar beets, cassava or corn. When a protein containing glutamic acid is broken down, for example through fermentation, it becomes glutamate. Glutamate activates our taste receptors, eliciting the delicious savory taste known as umami.

      <h4> History </h4>

      <div class ="posterAlign">

        <span id="desc">
          MSG was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda, who was trying to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of kombu, an edible seaweed used as a base for many Japanese soups. Evaporating and treating his wifeâ€™s kombu broth, he was able to extract a crystalline compound, which turned out to be glutamic acid. Tasting the crystals, he recognized a distinct savory flavor he dubbed umami, based on the Japanese word umai (delicious). Dr. Ikeda soon filed a patent to produce umami in an easy-to-use form: MSG (monosodium glutamate). The following year, the Ajinomoto Group got its start as MSG was launched on the Japanese market.
